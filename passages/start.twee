:: About [etc]
Hi baby,

Today's friend's day! There will be more on that in your <<linkreplace "card.">>card, but you'll only be able to read it after you make it through the actual story. ;)<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "How should I read this?">>==How should I read this?==
Ideally twice! I imagine reading the about page (where you are right now), the story you wrote, the card, and the story one more time.
There is a menu at the bottom of each passage, but you should ideally click through using the links within the text.
<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "What is this?">>==What is this?==
This is a bit of a strange gift. It almost feels like a cop-out. I assure you it isn't. Weeks ago, after texting with Kai, I was trying to figure out what to get you. I know you and Alice like personal gifts, so I decided to take a piece of writing that each of you had written and turn it into a <<linkreplace "Twine game.">>Twine game. It's not really a game though, more like a visual novel.<</linkreplace>><</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Why did you make this?">>==Why did you make this?==
I just wanted each of you to have a place where you could revisit <<linkreplace "one of your favorite pieces of writing.">>one of your favorite pieces of writing.

Though knowing you, I am sure you'd say something like, "your writing is my favorite though" or "alice's writing is my favorite!". So I picked my personal favorite of the oneshots I had on hand for you instead.<</linkreplace>>

For you specifically, I wanted to use this as a way to show you how I view your writing. Like a...what-does-Nhi-feel-and-see-when-reading-Sas's-writing-simulator. :) While making this for you, I thought a lot about what an ideal reading experience for you would be. Aesthetic, simple, and beautiful. Luckily, the Twine platform accomodates this nicely.<</linkreplace>>

I hope you enjoy!

Hi baby!

Predictably, I have prepared for you another twine for our friend day… Truly, I think hard over and put my whole little heart into making these, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve copped out by gifting another one for you.

But I think I have a good reason for them, especially this year. I remember you’ve been really anxious about not being able to write recently, like you’ve been stopped up. I also know you’ve said that it feels like you might not be able to write again ever.

I really mean it when art block like this eventually goes away. I’ve told you a hundred times, but I had an art block that lasted a long time once, about a few years, when my relationship with art was really unhealthy, as well as my relationship with myself.

The reason why it took years to work through was mostly because I was trying to pull through it alone. This was partly my fault. I didn’t really share my art with anyone, and I didn’t have an artistic community or even friends to talk to about it. Luckily, things got better as I finished university and found myself in a better place than before. But if I had some more support and encouragement, I would have returned to drawing a lot sooner than that, and with a healthier mindset as well.

So I wanted to gift you some things that might help you work through your writer’s block. First is one of our favorite threads in twine form, and second is Clarice Lispector’s complete cronicas collection (the latter of which is coming late. :( But most definitely coming, thanks to Kai and Alice!!!) in print form, because it just feels more special to have a print book than an eBook, I think!

I don’t know how long it’ll be before you find that you can write again. I just want you to know that it won’t be never, and that regardless of where we are in our lives, that I’ll always want to write with you, and your writing is just so important to me. There’s nothing else out there quite like writing with you, except maybe reading from you. Otherwise, everything else is a distant second, if it were even a comparable experience.
