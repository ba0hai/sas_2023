Hi baby, 

Happy birthday! There will be more on that in your [[birthday card|Card]], but you'll only be able to read it after you make it through the actual story. ;)

This is a bit of a strange gift. It almost feels like a cop-out. I assure you it isn't. Weeks ago, after texting with Kai, I was trying to figure out what to get you for your birthday. I know you and Alice like personal gifts, so I decided to take a piece of writing that each of you had written and turn it into a Twine game. It's not really a game though, more like a visual novel. 

I just wanted each of you to have a place where you could revisit one of your favorite pieces of writing. 

But for you specifically, I wanted to use this as a way to show you how I view your writing. Like a...what-does-Nhi-feel-and-see-when-reading-Sas's-writing-simulator. :)

I hope you enjoy!
